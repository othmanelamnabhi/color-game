# Javascript Simplified: Color Game

On this project from the [Javascript Simplified](https://javascriptsimplified.com) course, I made a guessing game where you need to choose which tile among the ones displayed corresponds to the generated color code.

You can choose in which format the color code is to be displayed and you can even set the game difficulty.

This assignement I'm particularly proud of because I thought long and hard about how I can make my code DRY:
* Extracting reusable code into functions
* giving the files a structure that made sense
* Adding options and default arguments to the functions

## Installation


* Clone the repo, `cd` into the directory and run `npm install` in the terminal then once install is done run `npm start`.
